<p class="margin">All students know the dred of getting home from school, checking their phone and then noticing they have a massive pile of homework due the very next day. On top of that, they are fairly certain that they understand literally none of the math and science concepts taught in class that day. Through our STEM project this year, we decided to take a new approach for these students by introducing a product that is able to not only save students massive amounts of time and money but also teach them a thing or two in the process. Helpyouwithyourhomework.ca is math and science based website which aims to do just as itâ€™s URL suggests.</p>
<p class="margin">Help you with your homework aims to help students not only finish their homework in a more timely manner, but also to help student further their understanding in difficult topics. The website is free to use and aims to offer help to all levels of high school students, no matter the subject or difficulty of there problem.  The service offers questions on a wide degree of topics ranging from Grade 9 Math issues to Grade 12 physics calculations. They are able to input the variables from there homework questions and have the computer answer it for them. This allows them to return to school with homework that has been completed correctly and on time.</p>
<p class="margin">The website intends to not only be a useful tool in helping students to solve there problems but also learn from the experience in an effort to complete their work on their own in the future. When they access the website, it displays a number of formulas that can be chosen that lead to a separate page. That page then displays the formula and allows you space to enter your variables. Coupled is a explanation of the formula, including its uses and coaching on how to potentially use the formula without the website. On the next page a result is displayed for the student to use and an option to return and reuse the formula. Whyle repeating the process, the student is constantly reminded of the formula and how to solve it. Through this process we hope the student is becoming more independent from the website every time they use it.</p>
